Particle system:

A particle sytsem created using my personal c++ engine.

Key Features:
1. Has support for GPU particles which was implemented using compute shaders (supports 1 million+ particle count).
2. Has support for CPU particles (supports ~450k particle count).
3. Has an interface through which particle effects can be created from scratch.
4. Has a module based interface for particle effects (similar to Unity).
5. Contains a particle zoo to exhibit different particle effects.

Controls:
F1 - toggle mouse input
WASD - Move
Mouse - camera orientation
Q/E - Up/Down
Arrow Keys - Change mode/zoo

Editor instructions:
After changing the properties in the editor, click on SAVE to see the changes reflected in the particles.
